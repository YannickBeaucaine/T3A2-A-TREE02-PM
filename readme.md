## R1 : Website Description
---

- ### Purpose :

TreeO2 is an API built to track trees planted by coffeee farmers in Timor Lest. It allows farmers to record and track information such as it's location, the type of tree, the name of the farm and the farmer, a farmer bio as well as the impact of the carbon footprint that their tree contributes to the ecosystem.

The tracked trees can then adopted by the customers of a TreeO2 partner. Adopters adopt a tree when purchasing coffee in person at a partner store. The current implementation of the API means partner businesses need to manually collect customer information and payment before manually assigning a tree to the customer through the API and then manually paying the money to TreeO2. The customer is then sent an email with a link a to a website which displays the latest tree they have adopted.

Our client, The Corner Store Network, has approached us to build a TreeO2 customer portal which interacts with the TreeO2 API. The purpose of this portal is to allow tree adopters to login and view information about all the trees they have adopted and to highlight the postive impact the organisation is having on farmers in Timor Lest. The portal will also allow customers to adopt trees online without having to go to a partner business in person. 

Our solution will cut down the amount of manual labour required to allow customers to adopt trees and thereby reducing labour costs by automating the process. It would additionally give the users and businesses more feedback about their contribuition by having a "live update" functionality. It will also be a good promotion for TreeO2 and it's partners, giving them an online presence and a localised hub for all information on TreeO2 in a user friendly format.

- ### Functionality / features :

 Abiltity to create a customer profile to access personal data and follow purchases history.
 
 Ability to directly adopt a tree at the click of a button using stripe as a secured payment system.

 Ability to acces data cards from their adopted trees showing relevant information such as the type of tree, the age, the carbon footprint, the farmer who planted the tree, and the location.

 Ability to see a map with all the trees planted by the partnering businesses collectively and measuring the impact on the carbon absorption.

 Abiltity to see all partnering stores and see relevant information about businesses.

 Ability as to create an administrator account to control and users profiles.

 Simple and intuitive user tested design. 
 
 User authentication.


- ### Target audience :

Partnering businesses currently using the system is only offering the service to costumers attending any of the their venues physically. The target audience are the Eco activists wanting to have a positive impact on the planet by adopting a tree to reduce the worlds carbon footprint and supporting farmer communities in need in the region of Timor-Leste.

## R5 : Wireframes for multiple standard screen sizes, created using industry standard software	
---
For this project we have used Adobe XD to wireframe and prototype our application and test user experience. We have initially started with making low resolution wireframes and a sitemap with our client to adapt the application to his needs. For this project we have designed our wireframes by using an agile method, creating our design by components to simplifiy changes requested by our client.
